# php2final

This is my final project for PHP Programming II at Gwinnett Technical College.

Task:
Create a PHP web application that allows visitors to view and enter comments and replies on your web site. A visitor can view, add, modify and delete comments or replies. This is intended to reproduce the comment functionality that can be found on many web sites, news sites, blogs, etc.
